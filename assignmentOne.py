# Recieve the price of a product exclusive the taxes from the user
priceExclusive = input("Skriv in priset exklusive moms: ")
# Change the int type of the input to a float number and multiply it with 1.25 to get the price inclusive taxes

"""
If the user inputs 100 as the price exclusive taxes the output will be 125.0 (not 125 since the calculation is done with floats).
A possible error is if the user input isn't a number. Then the program will crash since I don't have any error handling.
If there is any syntax errors, check the error message in the terminal or debugg the code by using breakpoints.
If there is any logical errors I can divide the calculation into smaller parts. First make the input to a float. Then multiply it
and assign the value to the variable.
